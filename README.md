# Monte-Carlo Simulations - Spring Semester 2024
This repo contains the source code and the referenced literature I used for my end of class assignment on Monte-Carlo simulations in R. Based on an unpublished manuscript by [Morey & Lakens (2016)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/71040160), I investigated the question "Why most of psychology is unfalsifiable" in three simulations. 

A slightly updated and improved version of the final simulation source code will follow soon...
